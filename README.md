# javascript-projects
This repository includes some of the side projects I have completed using JavaScript.

## JavaScript Clock
This is a JavaScript project that results in an analog clock on a webpage that shows the time based on the current time zone. It updates itself through rerunning a function over a set interval.

## Typing Speed Tester
This website tests typing speed using JavaScript. It works by checking the input text at every key press and to determine its correctness. When the entered text is complete and correct, the timer stops automatically.
